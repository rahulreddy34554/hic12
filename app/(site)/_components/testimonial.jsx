      "My trip is connected with AIG hospital. This hotel is walking distance from it. Staff is courteous, room is good. In house food can be a dampener for some because the place is strictly vegetarian. I got disappointed hearing that but vegetarian fare was quite enjoyable. Overall good experience.",

      "I have been in this hotel for 2 times. It was an excellent experience staying there most importantly the hygiene and the service was excellent. Friendly staff and great environment makes me feel better. If I would recommend a hotel in Hyd definitely it would be Hotel Inner Circle. Thank you for the great hospitality. Cheers!",
